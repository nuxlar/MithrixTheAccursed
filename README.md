# Mithrix the Accursed

The Accursed King of Nothing is faster, stronger, and has some tricks up his sleeve to make the battle more intense. This mod is completely configurable. The game defines a loop as ~5 stages so when I say 1 loop that means going to the moon "without looping".
The Default flow:

- Phase 1 You face off against Mithrix but he's faster, stronger, and with harder hitting abilities.
- Phase 2 Mithrix returns but brings along his creations with him.
- Phase 3 Mithrix's form becomes corrupted, his attacks become stronger, and a true shadow clone splits from him after his jump special.
- Phase 4 Your items are quickly stolen then Mithrix stays at the center of the arena while sending out deadly orbs along with his now weakened clone.

Most stuff is configurable (IF YOURE UPDATING DELETE YOUR MITHRIXTHEACCURSED CONFIG FILE):

- HP scaling per loop/player
- Mobility scaling per loop/player
- Skills (stocks/cooldowns)
- Umbral Mithrix (Mithrix becomes an Umbra for all phases - cosmetic)
- Umbral Clone (The glass clones are replaced with a singular perfect shadow of Mithrix - copies his abilities, yes ALL of them)
- Debuff Immunity (scorpions still work) (applies after 3 loops even with the config off)
- Debuff Resistance (immune to freeze/tentabauble) (applies after 2 loops even with the config off)

## Plans

- Nothing atm, I listened to a lot of feedback and made the mod EXTRA CONFIGURABLE so everyone can tune it the way they want. So not gonna update it till something breaks, I have new ideas for altering/improving the fight, or some new feedback comes up.
