# Mithrix the Accursed

The Accursed King of Nothing is faster, stronger, and has some tricks up his sleeve to make the battle more intense. Combined aspects of Artifact of the King and Inferno into the boss battle. A lot of the stats, skills, and options are configurable.

	- Phase 1 The Accursed King is resistant to debuffs and has a twisted form
	- Phase 2 skipped
	- Phase 3 attacks are more intense, spawns shadow clones if you don't take him out fast enough
	- Phase 4 items are absorbed quickly, watch out for his slam attack

Most stuff is configurable:

	- Stats
	- Skills
	- Twisted form (malachite - off by default)
	- Full debuff immunity (scorpions still work)
	- Phase 2 skip


## Plans
* Make a fully custom flow for the phases
	* Phase 1 regular buffed Mithrix that's resistant to debuffs (specifically immune to freezing/tentabauble) (I'll keep full immunity as a config for the masochists)
	* Phase 2 basically regular Phase 3
	* Phase 3 spawns in Perfected with shadow clones (1 per player), lunar chimera that spawn are perfected as well, maybe make his attacks more intense and beefier stats using a multiplier
	* Phase 4 slams more often, debuff immune to make it scarier? cuz he usually dissolves once everyone gets items back.
* Make the flow configurable (presets maybe, Lunar - Beefier AotK + Inferno, Accursed - My vision for the fight, Commando Must Die - For the masochistic risk player)
