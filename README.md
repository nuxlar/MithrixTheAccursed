# Mithrix the Accursed

The Accursed King of Nothing is faster, stronger, and has some tricks up his sleeve to make the battle more intense. Combined aspects of Artifact of the King and Inferno into the boss battle.

	- Phase 1 The Accursed King greets you and is resistant to debuffs (freeze/nullify)
	- Phase 2 He returns to test out his creations
	- Phase 3 The Accursed King's form becomes corrupted, releasing glass clones to aid him in battle
	- Phase 4 He absorbs items quickly and releases a deadly slam attack

Most stuff is configurable:

	- Stats
	- Skills
	- Full debuff immunity (scorpions still work)
	- Debuff Resistance (freeze/nullify - tentabauble)


## Plans
* Make Mithrix scale per loop (more loops, more players, more insano style Mithrix)
* Make the flow configurable (preset difficulties mayhaps, Lunar - AotK + Inferno with some accursed sprinkles, Accursed - My vision for the fight, Commando Must Die - For the masochistic risk player)
