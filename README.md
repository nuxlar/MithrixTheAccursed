# Mithrix the Accursed

The Accursed King of Nothing is faster, stronger, and has some tricks up his sleeve to make the battle more intense. Combined aspects of Artifact of the King and Inferno into the boss battle. A lot of the stats, skills, and options are configurable.

	- Phase 1 The Accursed King is resistant/immune to debuffs (configurable) and has a twisted form (malachite, configurable - off by default)
	- Phase 2 skipped because boring (configurable)
	- Phase 3 still resistant/immune, attacks are more intense and fatal, spawns shadow clones if you don't take him out fast enough
	- Phase 4 items are absorbed quickly, he is no longer resistant/immune but watch out for his slam attack
