# Mithrix the Accursed

The Accursed King of Nothing is faster, stronger, and has some tricks up his sleeve to make the battle more intense. Combined aspects of Artifact of the King and Inferno into the boss battle. A lot of the stats and skills are configurable.

	- Phase 1 a stronger, more agile enemy appears before you. The Accursed King is also immune to debuffs (configurable)
	- Phase 2 skipped because boring
	- Phase 3 still immune, attacks are more intense and fatal, spawns shadow clones if you don't take him out fast enough
	- Phase 4 items are absorbed quickly, he is no longer immune but watch out for that slam attack
